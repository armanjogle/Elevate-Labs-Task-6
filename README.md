# Elevate-Labs-Task-6
Task 6 focuses on using SQL subqueries and nested queries to retrieve specific results from the e-commerce database. It covers scalar and correlated subqueries, and the use of IN, EXISTS, and = within WHERE clauses to filter data, enabling more precise and dynamic data extraction.

# Task 6 â€“ Subqueries & Nested Queries

This task demonstrates using SQL subqueries in the `arman` e-commerce database.  
Queries include:
- **Scalar Subquery** â€“ single value extraction (e.g., maximum price)
- **Correlated Subquery** â€“ comparing each row to group averages
- **IN** â€“ finding matches in another query result
- **EXISTS** â€“ checking if related data exists
- **= (Equals)** â€“ matching a specific single value from a subquery
